# SpaceX-Falcon9-Landing-Prediction

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project develops a **machine learning pipeline** to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings. The ability to accurately predict landing outcomes is crucial for estimating launch costs, as SpaceX's cost advantage (62 million USD vs 165+ million USD for competitors) stems primarily from their first stage reusability.

**Business Impact**: Enables competitive rocket launch companies to make informed bidding decisions against SpaceX by predicting launch costs based on landing probability.
